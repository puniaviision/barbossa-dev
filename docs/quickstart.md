# Quick Start

Get Barbossa running in 5 minutes.

---

## Requirements

- **Docker** - [Install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Claude Max** - [Subscribe](https://claude.ai) (required for Claude Code CLI)
- **GitHub CLI** - [Install](https://cli.github.com/)
- **macOS or Linux** - Windows via WSL2

---

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Authenticate
gh auth login
claude login

# 2. Run install script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ADWilkinson/barbossa-dev/main/install.sh | bash

# 3. Start
cd barbossa && docker compose up -d

# 4. Verify
docker exec barbossa barbossa health
```

The script prompts for your GitHub username and repository, then creates everything for you.

To add more repositories later, edit `config/repositories.json`. See [Configuration](configuration.html) for all options.

**Tip:** Use Claude to help configure! Give it [llms.txt](https://github.com/ADWilkinson/barbossa-dev/blob/main/llms.txt) for context.

## Commands

```bash
docker exec barbossa barbossa health          # Check status
docker exec barbossa barbossa run engineer    # Run now
docker exec barbossa barbossa status          # Activity
docker compose logs -f                        # Logs
```

---

## What Happens Next

Barbossa runs automatically:
- **Discovery** finds issues and adds them to backlog
- **Engineer** picks from backlog and creates PRs
- **Tech Lead** reviews PRs and merges good ones

You wake up to PRs already merged. Set `auto_merge: false` in config if you prefer to merge manually.
